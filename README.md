# PokeScroll
Using the [pokeapi](https://pokeapi.co/docs/v2) to experiment with the Cache API and infinite scroll. The list of Pokemon are render from cache if available, otherwise fetches a large page of Pokemon using an internal retry mechanism if there's an error.

The UI is built with my [Mdash design system](http://m-docs.org).
